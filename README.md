## DBA Utility Scripts

A personal collection of database administration scripts I use in day-to-day DBA work, categorised by database type.

## Notes
- Scripts are provided **as-is** — review and test before running in production.
- Many scripts assume elevated privileges.
- Contributions are not expected; this is a personal working toolkit.
